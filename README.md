# CraiglistTesting
Project Goal
OBJECTIVE: The objective of our project is to test Craigslist to ensure that all of the functionalities are working. We will be testing functions such as text boxes, links, buttons, drop-down menus, search boxes, etc.
AIM: We aimed to demonstrate our skills in Java, Selenium, TestNG, and Maven through this testing suite. We also hoped to enhance our skills in creating code that tests complex elements of the website. Craigslist ended up being a straightforward website, so we had a very limited list of elements to test. 
System & Test Summary
The system or application that we tested was Craigslist. This website, in simple terms, is an advertising platform with sections dedicated to various social aspects. For example, the website has sections to advertise jobs, housing, gigs, resumes, etc. It is simple, yet effective, and has had the same design for over 25 years. 
Our test suite combines both integration and unit testing. Within the code, you will realize that you are able to run all of the classes together or separately if you so choose. We can achieve this through Maven and TestNG. You can also run the methods independently on SOME of the classes. Most of the classes have dependent methods because the entire class tests a specific aspect of Craigslist in its entirety. For example, the “PostCreation” class is all dependent methods because the test is continuous throughout the class. 
The test suite, we believe, covers the most important elements of the Craigslist website. We designed the test suite to be fluid, in the sense that it replicates what a user might do when utilizing the website, from logging in, searching, and creating a post. 
A list of our tests that were performed is shown below:
